<p>I’ve decided that any time someone insists on leading off a meeting or conversation with a fun fact, I’m simply going to copy and paste the link to the page.</p>
<p>When I was 9, I broke my leg in a motocross accident, bringing my
<a href="https://matthewevanaman.netlify.app/img/glory.jpg" target="blank" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#c05b4d'"> streak of glory
</a>
to a sudden end. I have only been on a bike
<a href="https://matthewevanaman.netlify.app/img/bike.jpeg" target="blank" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#c05b4d'"> one time </a>
since then. I still watch pro motocross and supercross, finding amusement in having an interest that my academic colleagues know nothing about.</p>
<p>I have a
<a href="https://matthewevanaman.netlify.app/img/daytona.jpeg" target="blank" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#c05b4d'"> hipster roommate </a>
who doesn’t pay rent and eats nonstop. She is
<a href="https://matthewevanaman.netlify.app/img/hyper.mov" target="blank" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#c05b4d'"> hyperactive
</a>
and has

</a><br />
for personal space.</p>
