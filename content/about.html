<p>You are probably here because of one of two reasons: either you were in
the same Zoom group as me and are following up on the link I provided when asked for a fun fact; or, you are here because you chose to investigate the potential existence of a website dedicated to one
Matthew E. Vanaman. In either case, you arrived here at your own volition to check out my website. Bless you.</p>
<p>Here some interesting (?) facts about me:</p>
<p>I used to race motocross, and we had a dirt bike track in our back yard. It was sweet indeed. Unfortunately my glory

were swiftly absconded with by a severely broken leg requiring airlift out of my back yard via helicopter. I peaked too early, as they say, and have only been on a bike

since. I still follow the sport closely, out of nostalgia and to maintain my blue-collar street cred among my ivory-tower colleagues.</p>
<p>Although possessing many of the quintessential traits of the head-in-the-clouds academic, I was in two

My solo was Pinball Wizard by The Who. For one moment, the light of the <a href="https://matthewevanaman.netlify.app/img/save_rock.jpg" target="blank" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#c05b4d'">

<p>It’s all downhill from here, really. I

<p>I now find myself trapped with a
